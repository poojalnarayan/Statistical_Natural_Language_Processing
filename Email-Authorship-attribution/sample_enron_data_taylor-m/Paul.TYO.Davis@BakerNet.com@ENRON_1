Dear Jane
We have previously advised Enron on the handling of customer data.
The Japanese Diet is now considering a bill for the protection of private data
that will bring in new rules and obligations for credit providers and others
handling private information. Under the bill, a person handling private data may
only use the data within the scope of the purpose disclosed to the individual
from whom the data was obtained. The bill also provides that the purpose must be
within reasonable limits and that private data may not be disclosed to a third
party without the prior consent of the individual from whom the information was
obtained.
Regards
