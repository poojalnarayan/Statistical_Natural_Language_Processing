I am pleased to attach for your review the opinion of Linklaters you 
requested addressing the question of whether EnronOnline's activities 
constitute "arranging" under the FSA 1986.  Kindly acknowledge receipt.

I trust this meets your requirements and look forward to receiving your 
confirmation of this at your earliest convenience.  Many thanks.

With best regards
